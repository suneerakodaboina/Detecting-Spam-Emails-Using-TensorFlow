# Detecting-Spam-Emails-Using-TensorFlow

Description:

This project focuses on building a Spam Email Detection system using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques with TensorFlow. The goal is to automatically classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) by analyzing their text content.

The model processes raw email text, performs text preprocessing and tokenization, and trains a neural network to accurately detect spam messages.

Features:

Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal)

Tokenization and padding using Keras

Train-test split for model evaluation

Deep learning model built using TensorFlow/Keras

Performance evaluation of spam vs ham classification

Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Pandas & NumPy

NLTK

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Workflow:

Import required libraries

Load and explore the dataset

Perform text preprocessing

Convert text to numerical sequences

Train a deep learning model

Evaluate model performance

 Output:

The trained model can effectively classify incoming emails as Spam or Not Spam, helping to reduce unwanted messages and improve email filtering systems.
